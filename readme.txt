== Description ==
The List Custom Taxonomy Widget is a quick and easy way to display custom post type categories (also known as custom taxonomies). Simply choose the taxonomy name you want to display from an auto-populated list. You can also set a title to display for the widget. Multiple list custom taxonomy widgets can be added to the same and other sidebars as well.

Please feel free to offer any feature suggestions you might have and I WILL consider them for future updates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I find the "Taxonomy Name" =
This is no longer necessary. If you're unsure which taxonomy to use, try the different ones until you find what you're looking for. All of the taxonomies available are listed.

= Where's the settings page? =
There is no (need for a) settings page. Simply go to appearance->widgets and drag the List Custom Taxonomy Widget into your sidebar(s) where you want to list the category/taxonomy.
