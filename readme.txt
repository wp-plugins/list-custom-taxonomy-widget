== Description ==
The List Custom Taxonomy Widget is a quick and easy way to display custom post type categories (also known as custom taxonomies). Simply enter the taxonomy name (NOT its label), which should contain no spaces. You can also set a title to display for the widget. Multiple list custom taxonomy widgets can be added to the same and other sidebars as well.

Please feel free to offer any feature suggestions you might have and I WILL consider them for future updates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I find the "Taxonomy Name" =
Go to the categories subpage under your custom post type. The URL should be [yoursite.com]/[wordpress directory]/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=[THE-TAXONOMY-NAME]&post_type=[the custom post type]. You can also make the plugin list the "category" taxonomy, which is the taxonomy for default wordpress posts.

= Where's the settings page? =
There is no (need for a) settings page. Simply go to appearance->widgets and drag the List Custom Taxonomy Widget into your sidebar(s) where you want to list the category/taxonomy.
